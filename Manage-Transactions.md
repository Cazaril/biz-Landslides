Manage Transactions


Sellers can manage the transactions related to their products in order to know how much money their products are generating, and to launch the revenue sharing process. To manage your seller transactions go to *Revenue Sharing* and click on *Transactions*

These transactions are aggregated and paid by the Business API Ecosystem periodically once a month. Nevertheless, if you need to be paid, you can force the revenue sharing calculus and payment of your pending transactions by manually generating a revenue sharing report.

To create a new report click on *New Report*

This process will aggregate all the transactions with the selected product classes, calculate the amount to be paid to each stakeholder using the related revenue sharing model, generate a revenue sharing report, and pay the seller and the stakeholders using their PayPal account.

You can see the generated reports clicking on *RS Reports*
