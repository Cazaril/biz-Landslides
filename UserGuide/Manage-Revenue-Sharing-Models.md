#Manage Revenue Sharing Models

Revenue Sharing Models specify how the revenues generated by an offering or set of offerings must be distributed between, the owner of the Business API Ecosystem instance, the provider of the offering, and the related stakeholders involved.

To manage RS models go to the *Revenue Sharing* section.
