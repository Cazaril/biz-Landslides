#Create Order

Customers can create orders for acquiring offerings. The different offerings to be included in an order are managed using the *Shopping Cart*.

To include an offering in the shopping cart there are two possibilities. You can
click on the *Add to Cart* button located in the offering panel when searching, or you can click on the *Add to Cart* button located in the offering details view.
