#Manage Received Orders

Sellers can manage the orders they have received in order to see the chosen characteristics, read customer notes, or process the order in case it has been acquired a physical product.

To view your received orders go to *My inventory* section, click on *Product orders*, and open the *Received* section.

If the acquired product is not digital, the order needs to be processed manually by the seller, in the sense that the seller will have to send the acquired product to the customer. To deal with this situation, the order details view allows sellers to manually change the status of the order.

To reject a received order you have to click in the *Reject* button located in the search or in the details view of the order.
